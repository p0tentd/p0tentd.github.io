    <p>test </p>

         <p>i feel like they are important to me, no matter how long ive had them e.g a teddy bear i got from my mom when i was around 5 and i slept with it for around 2 years, my parents started to want me to throw it away because i broke parts of the wool (i think) but i wanted to keep it because it held special sentimental value to me.</p>
         <p>i havent thrown it away this day but i dont sleep with it anymore. its just on my shelf, chilling, watching me in my room. this has been the same for years. idk its been like this for a long time and i kinda hope other ppl have the same experiences, like ive saved all the keyboards ive ever have and even things my dad owned and wanted to throw out i wanted to keep, i just feel like a collector of everything i've had or even someone close to me had, some things i have been lucky enough to sell/discard but it is rare for me to just randomly discard something.</p>
         <p class="end">/////////////</p>
         <p>its like an instinct to keep the item "alive" with me forever even though i know that isnt possible. my parents have even sometimes gotten mad at me over it which is kinda funny i think. my brother aswell thinks i am “weird” for it and says just sell it or something.</p>
         <p>even when i dont have any space for the specific item i make space for it, i put it on the floor its a weird habit but i like it, theres something important or of value to every single item ive ever owned.</p>
